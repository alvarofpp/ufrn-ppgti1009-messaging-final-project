## How to run

First you need to up the RabbitMQ broker and Postgres database:

```shell
make up-base
```

You can now up the restaurant's front-end and back-end apps:

```shell
make up-restaurant
```

After up the containers, you need to init the restaurant database:

```shell
make restaurant-db-reset
```

You can now test the restaurant API by going to `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
